We will see other, more important, applications in chapter 3 when using the adjustment formulas.\n",

    "\n",
    "If $A$ and $B$ are independent, it does **not** follow that $A$ and $B$ are independent conditional on $C$!\n",
    "\n",
    "By conditioning, we can relate two independent events. This is the \"conditioning on collider\" problem we will see later. Often this can be thought of as a \"selection bias\" -- the choice of conditioning on $C$ gives us a subpopulation, and that correlates $A$ and $B$ in the subpopulation, even though they are uncorrelated \"in nature\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple toy example: \n",
    "- If I roll two six-sided die, the outcomes are uncorrelated. \n",
    "- Call die 1's outcome $A$, and die 2's outcome $B$. $A$ and $B$ are independent. If I tell you what $A$ is, it doesn't help you determine what $B$ is (and vice-versa).\n",
    "- In games, we are often interested in the total, $C = A + B$. It is clear $C$ depends on $A$ and $B$.\n",
    "- If we condition on $C$, $A$ and $B$ are perfectly anti-correlated! e.g. If I tell you that \"I rolled a 7\" (C=7), knowing $A=3$ tells you $B=4$, even though $A$ and $B$ are independent.\n",
    "- $A$ and $B$ are _not_ conditionally independent on $C$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an example of poor naming: saying $A$ and $B$ are independent suggests a more powerful statement than $A$ and $B$ are conditionally independent given $C$, which isn't actually true.\n",
    "\n",
    "More serious examples:\n",
    "- [Berkson's paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkson%27s_paradox): originally the observation that diabetes and cholecystitis were negatively correlated _within hospital in-patients_. In general, this would be a problem with any two random diseases. People in the in-patient population have some ailment, so someone without diabetes in this population is _more_ likely to have other diseases than the general population (which is what causes them to go to the hospital)\n",
    "- Has application to survivor bias in survey completition\n",
    "- Also known as the \"explain-elsewhere\" affect: if an outcome can be achieved multiple ways, knowing it wasn't achieved one way makes the other ways more likely."
